This is a simple GraphQL API built with [Lighthouse - GraphQL Server for Laravel](https://github.com/nuwave/lighthouse).



Lighthouse is a PHP package that allows you to serve a GraphQL endpoint from your Laravel application. It greatly reduces the boilerplate required to create a schema, it integrates well with any Laravel project, and it's highly customizable giving you full control over your data.
